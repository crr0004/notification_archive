The following product proposal aim is to address the problem of being unable to
manage notifications on the Android platform. After experiencing the problem of
having too many notifications to properly process what the notifications are
trying to communicate, having this application to manage notifications should
aid in this. This application will provide an interface to track (list), time
delay replay (snooze) and delete notifications. The stretch goals of having an
interface to transfer notifications to other devices and archive notifications
on a cloud platform are also considered.
